# NupkgWrench
This extension is a wrapper around the NupkgWrench executable (https://github.com/emgarten/NupkgWrench) so you can use it more easily during your build / release process.  
At this time, v1.1.0 is included with this extension but in the near future, you will have to make sure that you have NupkgWrench executable installed on your build / release agent.

I will provide more detailed instructions when the time comes, along with an example how I use it during my builds & releases.
